  Project: Top Ten Favorite 
  
  Our Process of our Project: 
    
    We started off with our prototype in Figma. We spent about 4 hours maybe altogether. Then once we got it approved we started working on it immediately after we got it approved. Isaiah and Jeremy decided for Jeremy to make the GitHub Repository. Once Jeremy made the file he added the same amount of pages we had on the prototype which was 4 pages. Our four pages were an About Us, our Main Page, a Jeremy Page, and an Isaiah Page. Once the pages were made we started working on it. Jeremy first started on the Home page or the Main page and put together the lay out for it. Isaiah started working on his page and getting cards which is what we decided to use in our project to show off our top ten and within the cards will be pictures of our thing as well as adding a link with in the card title to go to a youtube how to video. Once Jeremy had finished the main page he worked on the About us page and added the carousels for both isaiah's and jeremy's about us as well as adding the text for it. Isaiah was working on the cards and getting all the cards to work and in perfect columns and rows as well as getting all the images within the right area. Once Isaiah finished Jeremy copied the cards code that Isaiah did and pasted it and changed the images to what his top ten is about as well as the info withing the card and the youtube links. Once we finished all that and fixed some simple centering mistakes we decided to try and tackle responsiveness. It wasn't like super super difficult Isaiah did most of the responsiveness for the page. We made our cards responsive first and that went well and worked perfect. But, once we tried to look at our page being responsive to a mobile device it all went down hill. It was mainly our About Us page that wasn't super good. All the text and images were to the left side instead of being centered as well as our navbar was going really really small and to the left side and wasn't the full size of the screen. But we fixed it and it was pretty simple to do and again Isaiah did most of the responsiveness. But after all that we were done for the most part. But, we then realized when we made the screen into a mobile screen our carousel would be really messed up and you could click the words to go the next image. So we decided to fix that by changing some of our images and making the carousel a specific size and that worked. 
    But all in all the project is done and we think it looks great.
